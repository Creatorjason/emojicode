/// This class is responsible for analysing the memory flow of a function.
///
/// Memory flow analysis is not an optimization step but an integral part of Emojicode memory management.
///
/// When analysing memory flow, Emojicode divides every use of a value into two *flow categories*:
/// - Borrowing Use: The value is never used in a way that could let the value escape. "Escape"
///   means any action that makes the value available outside stack memory, e.g. an instance variable assignment or
///   otherwise storing the value into heap memory. Note that this does not indicate whether the object will ever be
///   retained or not.
/// - Escaping Use: The value could escape as described above. This category is also used if the compiler cannot say for
///   sure that the use of the value is Borrowing.
///
/// In order to classify all uses of a value as accurately as possible, MFFunctionAnalyser exists. One of its key jobs
/// is to determine the flow category of every parameter and to set the MFFlowCategory of every parameter.
///
/// The flow category can then be used to perform certain optimization like allocating values on the stack instead of
/// on the heap.
///
/// Furthemore, to manage allocation Emojicode distinguishes every value created into two *value categories*:
/// - Temporary Value: The value is only retained for the duration of the statement. It is to be released at the end
///   of the statement. For example, an object created and immediately passed as an argument will be released at the
///   end of the statement. A temporary value, however, is not necessarily created by initialization. Retrieving a
///   variable also creates a temporary value.
/// - Taken Value: A taken value does not need to be released at the end of the statement. This, for instance, is the
///   case if the value was assigned to a variable.
///
/// There is no direct connection between the *value category* and the *flow category* of a value. All combinations of
/// the categories are possible. For example, a temporary value could be passed to a Borrowing or an
/// Escaping parameter, while a taken value could be a value assigned to an instance variable (escaping) or to a
/// constant local variable (borrowing).
